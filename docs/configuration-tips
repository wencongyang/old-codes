Tips for colo:

On master&slaver side, you should do the following things:
1. remove suspend lock file
   rm -f /var/lib/xen/suspend_*
2. bind dom0's vcpu to each pcpu
   For example: the machine has 4pvcpus:
        xm vcpu-pin 0 0 0
        xm vcpu-pin 0 1 1
        xm vcpu-pin 0 2 2
        xm vcpu-pin 0 3 3
3. bind network interface's interrupt to dom0's vcpu
   a. each network interface should have only one rx irq and
      tx irq, and rx/tx irq should be handled on the same cpu
   b. different network interface's irq should use different
      cpu
   c. don't bind the irq to cpu0, because vif's netback will
      run on cpu0
4. If the network interface that is used to forward packets is
   created by openvpn, the bandwidth is about 100Mb/s
5. don't use tso, sg, gso, lro, gro
   You should change offload parametes for the following network
   interface:
   a. the network interface that is used to forward packets
   b. the network interface that vif is bridged to
6. modify domU's network buffer:
   echo 1000000 >/proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max
   echo 1000000 >/proc/sys/net/core/wmem_max
7. update /usr/lib64/python/site-packges/xen/xend/XendCheckpoint.py
   modify colo_tap0 to the network interface to which you use to forward
   packets
8. create the following directory on master
   /root/yewei/source/pure/code
9. create the following directory on slaver
   /root/yewei/
10. copy script/HA_fw_runtime.sh to /root/yewei/source/pure/code on master
11. domU's network interface:
    add a new parameter to vif: colo_mode=1. For example:
    vif = [ 'mac=00:16:3f:00:00:11, bridge=eth1, colo_mode=1' ]
12. modify xend-config.sxp on slaver to allow migration a vm from master to
    slaver
13. modify xend-config.sxp on both master and slaver to create a bridge.
